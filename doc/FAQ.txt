What is ACM?
According to ACM's website, ACM is widely recognized as the premier membership organization for computing professionals, delivering resources that advance computing as a science and a profession; enable professional development; and promote policies and research that benefit society. ACM stands for the Association for Computing Machinery, and Missouri State ACM is a student chapter of this organization.
Why join ACM?
ACM offers several benefits for being a member. One of the most popular benefits is that, while being a student member, you have access to the MSDNAA software library, which provides free access to expensive Microsoft software. 

ACM also has guest speakers come in periodically to meetings and give presentations over their area of expertise. Last year these areas spanned health care, security and forensics. 

You may also meet other students with similar technological interests as you, and you may develop those interests even further as a result.
